## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the B24U Blood Donation Management System, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to the repository owner
2. **Include**: 
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Updates**: Regular updates on progress
- **Resolution**: Security fixes prioritized for rapid deployment

### Disclosure Policy

- We request 90 days to address the vulnerability before public disclosure
- We'll coordinate disclosure timing with the reporter
- Credit will be given to responsible reporters (unless anonymity is requested)

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **SQL Injection**: Use prepared statements for database queries
3. **XSS Prevention**: Escape output and validate input
4. **Authentication**: Implement strong password policies
5. **Session Management**: Use secure session handling
6. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors

### For Deployment

1. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
2. **Database Security**: Secure database credentials and access
3. **File Permissions**: Set appropriate file and directory permissions
4. **Updates**: Keep PHP, MySQL, and dependencies updated
5. **Backups**: Regular secure backups of data
6. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring

### For Users

1. **Strong Passwords**: Use complex, unique passwords
2. **Account Security**: Don't share login credentials
3. **Logout**: Always logout after sessions
4. **Updates**: Keep browsers updated
5. **Phishing**: Be aware of phishing attempts

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

- Password hashing using PHP's `password_hash()` function
- Session-based authentication
- Basic input validation
- SQL injection prevention through prepared statements

### Recommendations for Production

1. **SSL/TLS**: Implement HTTPS with valid certificates
2. **CSRF Protection**: Add CSRF tokens to forms
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for login attempts
4. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Consider 2FA for admin accounts
5. **Security Headers**: Implement security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
6. **Database Encryption**: Consider encrypting sensitive data
7. **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive audit trails

## Vulnerability Categories

We consider the following as security vulnerabilities:

### High Severity
- SQL Injection
- Remote Code Execution
- Authentication Bypass
- Data Exposure

### Medium Severity
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Information Disclosure
- Privilege Escalation

### Low Severity
- Minor Information Leakage
- Non-exploitable vulnerabilities
- Security misconfigurations

## Security Testing

We encourage:
- Responsible security testing
- Code reviews for security issues
- Static analysis tool usage
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
